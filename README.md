# util.161250

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of util.161250 is: - write some shortcuts and util functions
for my course work with 161250 - Learn more about package development
and create some things like pkgdown website etc.

I don’t expect any of this to of use to anyone.

## Installation

You can install the development version of util.161250 from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("1jamesthompson1/util.161250")
```

## Example

Currently there aren’t any useful examples.

But hopefully this isn’t that way for very long.

Also as a plus this ought to be rendered as a proper md file.
